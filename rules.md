- Use the following rules for React components:
  - The component should be named \<ComponentName>.
  - The component should be a functional component.
  - Container components should be used for fetching data
    - They should be named \<ComponentName>Container and the file name should be \<component-name>.container.tsx
    - Container components should leverage Apollo Client as the primary method for fetching data.
  - Always leverage components from Ant Design where possible.
  - Always specify type arguments, including useState, useForm, TableColumnsType, etc.
  - Type arguments should refer to data only by the fragment name or GraphQL input type name.
  - An interface or type should be defined for the component's props, named \<ComponentName>Props.
  - Any use of the AntDesign Table should leverage TableColumnsType 
  - Any use of the AntDesign Form should leverage useForm hook 
- Use the following rules for GraphQL in the UI project:
  - GraphQL files should accompany Container components.
  - The file should be named: \<component-name>.container.graphql
  - query and mutation naming convention should follow pattern: \<AreaName>\<ContainerName>\<QueryName|MutationName>
  - queries and mutations should leverage fragments for returned fields.
  - fragments should be named: \<AreaName>\<ContainerName>\<GraphQLTypeName>Fields
  - mutation fragments should be named: \<AreaName>\<ContainerName>\<GraphQLTypeName>MutationResultFields
