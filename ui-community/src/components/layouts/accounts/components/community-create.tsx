        <p>
          Getting started with your community is only a few clicks away.
          <br />
          Once you create it here you'll see it in the list of communities you have access to. <br />
          You will have access to both the member side and the admin side of your community. <br />
          Start by creating a name for your community, you can always change it later, you may want to make the name
          descriptive to avoid confusion with other communities with the same or similar names.
