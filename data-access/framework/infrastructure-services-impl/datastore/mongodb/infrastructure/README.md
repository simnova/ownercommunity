## DOMAIN ADAPTERS/CONVERTERS ##
Allows the persistance model to differ somewhat from the domain model.

Domain model contains the adapated persistance model and interacts with it directly in order to balance benefits of ORM and to give some degree of flexiblity.


Each Aggregate Root should have an adapter defined here.
