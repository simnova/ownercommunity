## Domain Events and Integration Events


### InProc Domain Events and Transactions:

InProc Domain Events are in-proc and executed in the same transactional scope as the Aggregate root. If an exception is thrown when processing a domain event, the Aggregate root is rolled back. 

### Integration Domain Events and Transactions:

Integration Domain Events are fired asynchronously and executed in a separate transactional scope. If an exception is thrown when processing a domain event, the Aggregate root is _not_ rolled back. If any integration event fails, it does not impact processing of other integration event handlers.

Other Notes:

- This project relies on MongoDB as the data-store - which supports embeded data models - and all tightly related data in the model is by default in the same transaction: [MongoDB Docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/data-model-design/#std-label-data-modeling-embedding) 
- While more recent versions of MongoDB Support multi-document transactions, this project is built on CosmosDB acting as MongoDB and does not support multi-document transactions at the moment.
