# Entity

> #### Definition Of Entity
>
> An object primarily defined by its identity is called an Entity.

### Key Characteristics of Entities

1. **Identity:** Entities have a unique identifier that distinguishes them from other entities, even if their attributes are identical. This identity persists as long as the entity exists, regardless of changes to its attributes.
2. **Mutability:** Entities can change over time. Their attributes may be updated, but their identity remains constant.
3. **Encapsulation:** Entities encapsulate both their state (data) and behavior (methods that reflect business operations or rules).
